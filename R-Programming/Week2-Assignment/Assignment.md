# Data

The zip file containing the data can be downloaded here: [specdata.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2Fspecdata.zip). 
The zip file contains 332 comma-separated-value (CSV) files containing pollution monitoring data for fine particulate matter (PM) air pollution 
at 332 locations in the United States. 
Each file contains data from a single monitor and the ID number for each monitor is contained in the file name. 
For example, data for monitor 200 is contained in the file “200.csv”. 
Each file contains three variables. 
Date: the date of the observation in (year-month-day) format, 
sulfate: the level of sulfate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter), 
and nitrate: the level of nitrate PM in the air on that date (measured in micrograms per cubic meter)

## Part-1

Write a function named ‘pollutantmean’ that calculates the mean of a pollutant (sulfate or nitrate) across a specified list of monitors. 
The function ‘pollutantmean’ takes three arguments: ‘directory’, ‘pollutant’, and ‘id’. 
Given a vector monitor ID numbers, ‘pollutantmean’ reads that monitors’ particulate matter data 
from the directory specified in the ‘directory’ argument and returns the mean of the pollutant across all of the monitors, 
ignoring any missing values coded as NA.

pollutantmean("specdata", "nitrate", 23)

[1] 1.281


## Part-2

Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports the number of completely observed cases in each data file. 
The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is the number of complete cases.

 6 25  463
 

complete("specdata", 3)

   id nobs
   
 1  3  243


## Part-3

Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation between 
sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. 
The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.

For this function you will need to use the 'cor' function in R which calculates the correlation between two vectors. Please read
the help page for this function via '?cor' and make sure that you know how to use it.
